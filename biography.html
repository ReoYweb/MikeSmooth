          <p class="test">
            Music maturity came swiftly for the now seasoned-veteran Robbert van
            de Corput, better known as Hardwell. At the age of 25, the young
            Dutch titan capped off a 10 year journey when he was crowned World’s
            #1 DJ in the 2013 DJ Mag Top 100 DJs Poll cementing his position as
            the electronic scenes newest superstar DJ and becoming the youngest
            ever winner of the coveted Top 100 DJs award. In 2014 the Dutch
            megastar did it again - being crowned World’s #1 DJ in the 2014
            edition of DJ Mag’s Top 100 DJs Poll for a second consecutive year.

          <p>
            Despite relinquishing his crown in 2015, though still taking the
            highly respectable second-place spot, it’s clear that Hardwell has
            already created a legacy that would put most of his counterparts to
            shame. This award-winning DJ, producer, musician, label owner and
            lover of all things music has not only helped shape the current
            state of EDM, but has left an everlasting imprint on it.

          <p>
            Like his great mentor Tiësto, Hardwell proudly hails from Breda, a
            city tucked deep within the Netherlands. Having first established
            his name at the tender age of 14, Hardwell has since elevated his
            clubland standing to impressive, dizzying heights. His serving of
            big room bangers over the past year has seen a bundle of anthems
            sweep charts and dancefloors worldwide. Label boss of Revealed
            Recordings and collecting a plethora of Beatport #1’s (no less than
            7 consecutive #1’s in 2013 alone), his studio output has never been
            more prolific or more on point.
          </p>

          <h3 class="underTitleA">Thanks</h3>
          <p>
            Now with all eyes on his new artist album, which will include tracks
            such as his latest single ‘Young Again’ with Chris Young on vocals,
            Hardwell is building up to the most exciting musical period in his
            career so far.
